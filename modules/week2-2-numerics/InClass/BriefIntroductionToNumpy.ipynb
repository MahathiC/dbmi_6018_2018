    "Remember that every technology, including a programming language like Python, is developed to solve some set of preconceived problems. Scientific computing was not in the initial vision of the Python developers, consequently there was not developed within the native language an efficient way of representing large collections (arrays) of numbers. Nonetheless, early on people doing scientific computing decided that Python was a nice language to work with, so they started creating third-party packages (packages that have to be added to Python) to deal with arrays of numbers. In the 1990s and early 2000s there were two competing packages called *numeric* and *numarray*. Numpy, the current defacto package for numeric arrays is in some ways a merger of the two packages.\n",

    "* `int8`: I have to use one bit to represent +/-, so I'm left with 7 bits to represent values. My most negative number is $-2^7$ and the most positive number is $2^7-1$ (the $-1$ accounts for $0$).\n"
