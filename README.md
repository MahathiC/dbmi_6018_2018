* Brian E. Chapman, Ph.D.: <brian.chapman@utah.edu>

### Teaching Assistants

* Annie Bowles

## Prerequisite

Prior to starting this course, the student must have completed a basic programming class. Online courses, such as [codecademy’s Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) or [Coursera's Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), are fine with proof of completion. We have also created a DataCamp course that the students can take for free as preparation when they enroll in this class. Please contact the instructor for details.

## Course Description

This course will provide students in the biological and medical domains the foundational programming skills to create computer programs to manage and analyze data drawn from biological, clinical, and public health domains. Working with the Python programming language, students will learn how to write procedural and object oriented programs. Mathematical principles relevant to biomedical data science will be reviewed through programming examples and problems. Students will also develop competency in using software version control with git as well as how to work within Linux computing environments.

### Learning Objectives

1. Acquire basic software engineering skills (git, documentation, unit  testing) that they follow in their own code  development.											
2. Recognize the components of a good program and software development process											
3. Build python skills and create biomedical software applications in the Python programming language											
4. Develop pipelines for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing biomedical data.											
5. Apply basic mathematical principles (e.g. set  theory, first order logic, calculus, linear algebra,  probability, and graph theory) to motivate and  in form computational problems in biology and  healthcare. (Programmers) 											
6. Acquire mathematics literacy that will facilitate effective reading of the relevant  biomedical literature.  											
7. Given a task within your field, follow the polya method to develop a prototype solution											
8. Exhibit confidence for self-directed expansion of their programming skills.          											


## Text Books

### Required

* [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Second Edition
With Application to Understanding Data](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition) by John V. Guttag

* [Elements of Mathematics
From Euclid to Gödel](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10697.html) by John Stillwell.

### Additional Resources

* I will be drawing heavily on [Once Upon an Algorithm](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/once-upon-algorithm) by Martin Erwig

* I will make a PDF copy of Allen Downey's *Think Python, version 2* available through Canvas. This is book with a Creative Commons license, so if you are interested you can [clone](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2), edit, and build your own copy of the book.

* There are a number of very useful books that are available online through the University of Utah's subscription to the [Safari Technical Books Online](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/).

### Additional Resources

* [Doing Math with Python](https://www.nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)
* [Mathematics for the Life Sciences](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461472759)
* [Mathematics in the Real World](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461485285)



## Evaluation Methods

1. Quizzes: **10%** of grade.
  * Quizzes will be based on class-preparation materials to ensure that the students have reviewed the materials prior to the start of class.
1. Class Participation: **15%** of grade
    1. Stuents are expected to attend class and participate in group activites. In-class assignments will form part of the grade.
1. Homework Assignments: **35%**
1. Term Project: **20%**
1. Midterm Exam: **10%**

##  Teaching and Learning Methods                 

This class will follow a “flipped classroom” paradigm. Students will be expected to watch prepared videos and read relevant on-line materials prior to the start of class. Class time will be spent answering questions raised by on-line materials, clarifying topics, and participating in individual and group hands-on activities. Students will be working in groups following the Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) method.
